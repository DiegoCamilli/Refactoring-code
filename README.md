# Code Refactor 
In this assignment I had to go throgh the code and make changes to fix the clients website.
A code Refactor is when we take existing code and make changes to fix bugs, orginize, and create DRY code.

## Link issuse
There were some issuse involving the links not working. For this it seems that the starter HTML had contained the Links in a Div instead of a Nav. this was a simple change to make them work. In addition i had to change the class call in the CSS to get the propepr section.

One of the links was missing is ID so when the link was clicked by the user it did not navigate the user to the proper section. This  was a simple fix and a simple addition of an ID

## CSS organization 
In the CSS i felt that there was repetative instances of Font family, so i made it so that there is only one instance of the font family and applied it to all sections it was wanted. This made for DRY code

In addition, i organized each of the different topics to make navigating and finding things in the CSS easier and cleaner.

In the assignment we need to have the navigating links on the Right side at the same level as the Company logo at the top, However i was unable to do this, i had done so but lost my progress and have not been able to do it again.
